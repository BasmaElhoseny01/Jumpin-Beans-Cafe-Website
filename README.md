# Jumpin-Beans-Cafe-Website
It is a static page for a coffee shop. It is direct practice on HTML and CSS 

This web page is my firts task in web devlopment Course offered by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BetaAcademy.B">Beta Academy</a>.

The main page to run is index.html

### Notes:
 • The page is static because no Java Script code is used only styling is used for only practice. Later I will update it with more actions :) <br>
 • The buttons in the header are links but are directed to nothing. Only the links in the footer are directed to my social media accounts.
